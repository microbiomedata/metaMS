Metabolomics Workflow
==============================

.. image:: metams_workflow2024.svg

Workflow Overview
-------

The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics workflow (metaMS) has been developed by leveraging PNNL's CoreMS software framework.
The current software design allows for the orchestration of the metabolite characterization pipeline, i.e., signal noise reduction, m/z based Chromatogram Peak Deconvolution,
abundance threshold calculation, peak picking, spectral similarity calculation and molecular search, similarity score calculation, and confidence filtering, all in a single step.

Workflow Availability
---------------------

The workflow is available in GitHub:
https://github.com/microbiomedata/metaMS

The container is available at Docker Hub (microbiomedata/metaMS):
https://hub.docker.com/r/microbiomedata/metams

The python package is available on PyPi:
https://pypi.org/project/metaMS/

The databases are available by request.
Please contact NMDC (support@microbiomedata.org) for access.
